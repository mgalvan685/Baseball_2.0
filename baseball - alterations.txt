Hits
----
-pitches - use current random numbers
-each player starts with .284 batting avg (2016 overall average)
-for each hittable pitch:
	-random number 1-100
		-sould not be a whole number
	-take batting avg * 100
		*may not have to do this if the random number is
		 between 0 and 1...
	-if random number is less than or equal to batting average, hit
	-if below, strike
-should have something to be able to get a hit if avg is .000
-maybe add more random numbers to lower scoring chances to make
 it more realistic
